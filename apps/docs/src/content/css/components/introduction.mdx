Winnie CSS provides a css-only set of component primitives based on `data-` attributes. But there is a catch, these components are only *spacially* styled. Spatial components are beautifully crafted with all of the layout, spacing, font sizes, radii, etc already done for you. All you need to do is add color.

## Import

Import all of the component styles.

```css
@import "@winnie-ui/component";
```

## Example

Spatial components provide you with the ability to customize your components to match your brand or style, while we handle details that consume most of your time.
