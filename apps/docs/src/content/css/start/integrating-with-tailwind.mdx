description: Use Winnie CSS with Tailwind style your application.

Before you get started, [install and configure](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) Tailwind in your application.

## Installation

### Install Winnie CSS for Tailwind

The simplest way to get up and running with Winnie CSS in any app is to start by installing Winnie CSS with the package manager of your choice. We will use `npm`, but `yarn` and `pnpm` also work as well.

```bash
npm install @winnie-ui/tailwind
```

### Import the Style Sheet

Once you have Winnie CSS for Tailwind installed, you can then import the stylesheet in the root of your application.

```css title="global.css"
@import "@winnie-ui/tailwind";
```

### Configure your Theme

Now, with Winnie CSS installed and imported, it's time to configure your theme. Winnie CSS allows you to choose the accent color, scale and border radius of your app.

```tsx title="root.tsx" {6-10}
export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>...</head>
      <body
        class="winnie-ui"
        data-accent-color="purple"
        data-scale="100%"
        data-radius="md"
        data-theme="light"
      >
        <App />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

To see how these different attributes affect the look and feel of an application, play around with the theme selector located in the top left. Everything in this documentation is built 100% with Winnie CSS.

## FAQ

### Why Tailwind V4 only?

Winnie CSS makes use of a new Tailwind feature in V4 which allows you to define a custom Tailwind theme using CSS. For more information see [CSS First Configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#css-first-configuration).
