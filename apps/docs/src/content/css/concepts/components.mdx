Winnie CSS provides a css-only set of component primitives based on `data-` attributes. But there is a catch, these components are only *spacially* styled. Spacially styled components are beautifully crafted with all of the layout, spacing, font sizes, radii, etc already done for you. All you need to do is add some color.

  <ComponentsHero />
